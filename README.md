Java Coding Test

Write a program in Java that accepts as input a filename of common words and a filename of text 
that outputs the word counts of the text after the common words are removed sorted by count descending and formatted nicely.

Usage:  
java example.YourClass common.txt alice.txt

Example Output:
Alice:    10,203
Foo:          12
Bar:          11
Baz:           3
Longword:      1

Here's a list of common words:

This is an open book pass/fail test.  It's not intended to grade your skills (e.g. "You got a B+"), nor is this a trick question.  
The intention is to weed out applicants who say they know Java when in fact
they have only played around with it (you know who you are!).  

Frankly, this is an easy test and you shouldn't spend more than an hour on it.  
That said, a professional programmer will read your code and it will definitely establish a baseline for your 
actual interview, so a little fit and finish will go a long way.

Advice:  Feel free to showboat but whatever you write should work.

Please submit your Java file(s) via email or a dropbox file.  Please do not post your solution publicly or on your GitHub page.
